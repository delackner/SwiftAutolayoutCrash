SwiftAutolayoutCrash
====================

Simple crash case in autolayout when transitioning

Run the app, then press GO twice (transitioning via pushViewController)
then press BACK twice (transitioning via popViewController)

Crashes pretty horribly on IOS7.1.1 and IOS7.1.2 *devices*, not on the simulator.
